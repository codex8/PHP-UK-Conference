<p>The Unconference track will run in tandem with the main conference track on both days and this year our 
unconference host and chair will be <a href="http://antz29.com" target="_blank">John Le Drew</a> who will be running the show.</p>

<p>In true unconference fashion, anyone can speak and it is often an opportunity to learn about some of the more
 off the wall topics, see speakers try out material destined for the main tracks of future conferences 
 and even speak yourself (really, we want to hear you speak!).</p>

<h1 class="uncon">So you have something to say?</h1>
<h2 class="blue">We want to hear you speak (yes, we mean you...)</h2>

<p>So if you want to speak, drop John an <a href="mailto:phpukuncon@antz29.com">e-mail</a> or come and find him throughout the day and he will slot 
you into the schedule. Generally, a talk will be either 15 minutes or 30 minutes with some time for questions 
at the end, but if you have a longer or shorter talk please come and speak to John as 
we can probably still fit you in; it is the uncon after all, powered by the unpredictable.</p>

<p>The relaxed atmosphere of the uncon is the perfect place to dip your toe into speaking and get useful 
feedback about your talk. So don't be shy, we don't bite!</p>

<h1 class="uncon">Quickfire!</h1>
<h2 class="blue">5 minute talks delivered in quick succession</h2>

<p>On the last day, for the last session we will be running quickfire talks. How this works is that all the speakers 
sit in a line at the front, the first speaker stands up and a 5 minute timer starts, when his time is up a siren sounds, 
the next speaker stands up and on we go. If you are inspired to speak, all you do is join the line, and we keep going 
till we run out of time.</p>

<p>If you want to join in, just turn up for the last session at 15:40 on the last day and join the line.</p>
