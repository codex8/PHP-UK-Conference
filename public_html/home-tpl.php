<p>This year's conference is the most exciting PHP UK ever! We have a fantastic schedule with great speakers from all around the world. Our keynotes are the
brilliant <a href="aralbalkan.com" target="_blank">Aral Balkan</a> who will open Friday's sessions and the Diabolical Devloper, who after many years tormenting the Java community,
 has turned his attention to PHP. Be afraid!

Great conferences are not just about what you do in the day - they are about networking and the friends you will make in the evening. We think this is especially important - 
so we have plans for you! 
Friday night we are hosting our mid-conference social. We'll start at the conference venue with a huge prize raffle, open for all delegates. We'll have FREE drinks and FREE snacks for a couple hours giving you a chance to meet and network with all the other delegates and check out the exhibits too. If you're participating in the <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/php-uk-conference-hackathon/">Hackathon</a> or want to pop by and check it out, it'll be running until 11pm. We'll then move on to <a href="http://www.amber-bar.co.uk/">Amber Bar</a> just <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2X7eL" target="_blank">around the corner</a> from the conference centre for more FREE drinks. We'll be in the Milk bar. Don't forget to bring your conference badge to gain entry.
