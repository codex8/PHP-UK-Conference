          Automattic is a startup of less than two hundred people trying to democratize publishing on the open web. 
          We're a distributed company scattered across some 60+ countries, but brought together by a common purpose. 
          As well as contributing to Core WordPress, our projects include WordPress.com and WP.com VIP, 
          Jetpack, Akismet, VaultPress, Gravatar, Code Poet, Plinky, VideoPress, After the Deadline, and Intense Debate. 
          They solve different problems, but are all unified in their goal of making publishing easier and better for everyone.

          PHP is in our DNA, it's what WordPress is built on. As strong believers in Open Source, 
          most of our work is available under licenses like the GPL. Much like PHP, we're here to make the web a better place, 
          and a more open one while we're about it.
